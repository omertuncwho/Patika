    <h4>About Me</h4>
    <p>Hello, I'm Ömer Tunç. I entered the world of technology with my education in computer programming and management information systems. However, my interest in technology is not limited to just that.

        I have hobbies such as amateur radio and electronic sound generators. Through these hobbies, I enjoy continuously improving myself and keeping up with technological innovations.
        
        In addition to that, I also enjoy being in touch with nature. I engage in activities like aquascaping and bushcraft, which allow me to connect with the beauty of nature. In doing so, I develop myself in terms of preserving natural life and gaining a better understanding of nature.
        
        While leading a life filled with technology, nature, and hobbies, I also take pleasure in working professionally.</p>
